# watch-project-2025
C++ code for my ongoing smartwatch Project

The thesis of this project is to create a smartwatch that connects to apple and android phones, allowing integration with music, maps and notifications. The watch will be designed to run mostly in the esp32c6's sleep mode to account for small battery life and communicate with the phone using BLE and wifi for access to NTP servers.General Administration in a professional workspace.
 File organisation, inventory checks, analysis of CQC data.

The watch will be controlled by rings attached to the hand, allowing for "gesture control" rather than traditional buttons and dials. This allows for one handed control. 

Hardware included: Seeed Studio XIAO esp32c6, 2x flex sensors, 0.96 inch oled, 100mAh LiPo battery.
