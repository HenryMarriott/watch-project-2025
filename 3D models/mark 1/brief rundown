had two separate sections. One for the battery and screen, and one for the esp32c6 and wiring. (the battery was 300mAh for this design)

This design failed due to overcomplicated design. Having wires between the two sections that would regularly bend was not a sustainable design under wear, especially given that the PCB required surface mounted pads for wires which were especially delicate.

The lessons learnt from this design:
the concept works. 
avoid wires and surface mounting where possible and opt for headers and molex picoblades for connectors.
size needs to be reduced to allow a single section, similar to a more traditional watch look
